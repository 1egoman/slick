# Slick

Slick is an improved and more customizable slack client:

- Slick is controlled with the keyboard, so anybody with fingers can work fast. Slick uses a
  [modal](docs/Modes.md) workflow just like vi.
- Slick is scriptable. Add new commands (ie, `/foo`) or keyboard bindings (ie, press `a`) and bind
  them to custom functions written in [lua](//lua.org). [Learn More](docs/Scripting.md)
- Slick is terminal based. Reduce the number of [chrome vms](https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/) that are running on your computer.
- Slick is written in [go](//golang.org), which means the entirety of the app is in a single binary.
  [Installation](docs/Installing.md) and [Auto updates](docs/AutoUpdate.md) are a breeze.

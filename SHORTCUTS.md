# Modes
- `chat`: the normal mode
- `writ`: type and send a message to someone else
- `pick`: switch channels

## Switching modes
By default, you're in `chat` mode. To switch to `writ` mode, press `w` and start typing your
message. Leave `writ` mode by pressing `ESC`, backspacing past the beginning of the command bar, or
sending your message.

To switch a connection / channel, press `p` to move to `pick` mode. Start typing the name of your
channel and use `ctrl+j` / `ctrl+k` / arrow keys to pick one. Press enter to select and return back
to `chat` mode.

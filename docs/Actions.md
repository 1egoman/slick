# Actions

Attachments and files both have a number of named actions after them:

![Two Actions](gifs/Actions.md)

The highlighted letter indicates what key to press to trigger the action. (In the above action,
press `o` to open the attachment.)

## Multiple sets of actions

Sometimes, you'll come across a message with multiple attachments (and multiple sets of actions):

![Multiple Attachments](gifs/ActionsMultiple.md)

Pressing `o` in this instance would only open the first file. In order to effect other files, prefix
the action name with a number corresponding to the index of the attachment. For example, to open
bar.txt press `2o`.
